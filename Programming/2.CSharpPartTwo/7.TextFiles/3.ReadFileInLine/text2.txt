1 There is one other point of interest in the inventory program. Notice how the end of the
2 file is detected. Since the binary input methods throw an EndOfStreamException when
3 the end of the stream is reached, the program simply reads the file until either it finds the
4 desired item or this exception is generated. Thus, no special mechanism is needed to detect
5 the end of the file.
