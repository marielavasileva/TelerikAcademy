There is one other point of interest in the inventory program. Notice how the end of the
file is detected. Since the binary input methods throw an EndOfStreamException when
the end of the stream is reached, the program simply reads the file until either it finds the
desired item or this exception is generated. Thus, no special mechanism is needed to detect
the end of the file.
Up to this point, we have been using sequential files, which are files that are accessed in a
strictly linear fashion, one byte after another. However, you can also access the contents of a
file in random order. One way to do this is to use the Seek( ) method defined by FileStream.
This method allows you to set the file position indicator (also called the file pointer or simply
the current position) to any point within a file.
