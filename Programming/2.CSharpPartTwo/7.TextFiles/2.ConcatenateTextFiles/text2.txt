Up to this point, we have been using sequential files, which are files that are accessed in a
strictly linear fashion, one byte after another. However, you can also access the contents of a
file in random order. One way to do this is to use the Seek( ) method defined by FileStream.
This method allows you to set the file position indicator (also called the file pointer or simply
the current position) to any point within a file.
