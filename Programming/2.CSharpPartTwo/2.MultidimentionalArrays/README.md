Write a program that fills and prints a matrix of size NxN as shown below: (examples for N = 4)
1  5	9	13
2	6	10	14
3	7	11	15
4	8	12	16
1	8	9	16
2	7	10	15
3	6	11	14
4	5	12	13
7	11	14	16
4	8	12	15
2	5	9	13
1	3	6	10
1	12	11	10
2	13	16	9
3	14	15	8
4	5	6	7
Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix of size NxM and finds in it the square 3x3 that has maximal sum of its elements.
We are given a matrix of strings of size NxM. Sequences in the matrix we define as sets of several neighbor elements located on the same line, column or diagonal. Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix. Example:
ha	fifi	ho	hi
fo	ha	hi	xx
xxx	ho	ha	xx
s	qq	s
pp	pp	s
pp	qq	s
Write a program, that reads from the console an array of N integers and an integer K, sorts the array and using the method Array.BinarySearch() finds the largest number in the array which is <= K.
You are given an array of strings. Write a method that sorts the array by the length of its elements (the number of characters composing them).
* Write a class Matrix to hold a matrix of integers. Overload the operators for adding, subtracting and multiplying of matrices, indexer for accessing the matrix content and ToString().
* Write a program that finds the largest area of equal neighbor elements in a rectangular matrix and prints its size. Example:
1	3	2	2	2	4
3	3	3	2	4	4
4	3	1	2	3	3
4	3	1	3	3	1
4	3	3	3	1	1
Hint: you can use the algorithm "Depth-first search" or "Breadth-first search".
