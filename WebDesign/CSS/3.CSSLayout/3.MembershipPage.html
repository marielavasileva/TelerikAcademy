                    HTML5 is a rebel. It was dreamt up by a loose group of freethinkers who weren’t
                    in charge of the official HTML standard. It allows page-writing practices that were
                    banned a decade ago. It spends thousands of words painstakingly telling browser
                    makers how to deal with markup mistakes, rather than rejecting them outright.

                    It finally makes video playback possible without a browser plug-in like Flash. And
                    it introduces an avalanche of JavaScript-fueled features that can give web pages
                    some of the rich, interactive capabilities of desktop software.
